# ✅ Simple TDD Todo React/Redux app ✅

A tech test – build a todo list app using TDD, with React and Redux. Todo tasks can be added to the list, marked as completed or deleted. Todo tasks are wiped with the session (there's no database, yet!).

Used the Redux [Todo tutorial](https://redux.js.org/basics/example-todo-list) for guidance.

View the [final online demo here](http://tdd-todo.surge.sh/).

### *Requirements*
* *Build a form so that Todo tasks can be submitted*
* *Display the Todo tasks below the form*
* *Allow Todo tasks to be marked as complete*
* *Allow Todo tasks to be deleted from the list*
* *Make the app look less ugly*

### *Possible next steps*
* *Style the radio button as a checkbox that is ticked or not ticked as appropriate*
* *Add views for the Todo list – completed, deleted, all etc.*
* *Add routes and MongoDB so that a user can save their list and come back to it*
