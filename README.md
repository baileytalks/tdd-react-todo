# ✅ Simple TDD Todo React/Redux app ✅

A tech test – build a todo list app using TDD, with React and Redux. Todo tasks can be added to the list, marked as completed or deleted. Todo tasks are wiped with the session (there's no database, yet!).

View the [final online demo here](http://tdd-todo.surge.sh/).

### *Requirements*
* *Build a form so that Todo tasks can be submitted*
* *Display the Todo tasks below the form*
* *Allow Todo tasks to be marked as complete*
* *Allow Todo tasks to be deleted from the list*
* *Make the app look less ugly*
